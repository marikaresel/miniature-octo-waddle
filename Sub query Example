Here is a SQL query that I did to find the top 5 customers from which Country
WITH top_5_customers_cnt_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country, total_amount_paid) AS
(SELECT A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country, 
 SUM(E.amount) AS total_amount_paid
 FROM customer A
 INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
 INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
 INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
 INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
 WHERE C.city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Amba/ur', 'Shanwei', 'So Leopoldo', 'Teboksary', 'Tianjin', 'Cianjur')
 GROUP BY A.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country
 ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
 LIMIT 5)
SELECT D.country, 
COUNT (A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, 
COUNT (top_5_customer_cnt_cte) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
LEFT JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
LEFT JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
LEFT JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_5_customer_cnt_cte ON A.customer_id = top_5_customer_cnt_cte.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
